# **Implementation Design for `commit` Command**

---

## **1. Overview**

The `commit` command commits the files that are currently staged in Codetrack. It updates the index with a new commit, storing file contents, commit metadata, and updating branch references.

---

## **2. Functionality Breakdown**

### **Command Execution:**
- **Command:** `commit`
- **Description:** Commits the files that are in the staging area, recording the state of the tracked files and associated metadata.

### **Execution Steps:**

1. **Command Arguments:**
   - `msg` (or `-m`): The commit message describing the changes.

2. **Determine Current Directory:**
   - Use `cwd()` from the process module to get the current working directory.

3. **Call Status Handler:**
   - Invoke the `statusHandler` function from the `status.js` module to ensure the status of the index is updated before committing.

4. **Read Index and Prepare Commit:**
   - Read the existing index file (`.codetrack/index.json`).
   - Generate a unique commit ID using the current timestamp.

5. **Store Files:**
   - For each file path in the index:
     - Check if the file is stored in the `.codetrack/objects` directory.
     - If not, read the file and write its contents to the `.codetrack/objects` directory with the corresponding commit ID.

6. **Update Index File:**
   - Write the current index object to a new file in the `.codetrack/indices` directory, named with the commit ID.

7. **Update Branch References:**
   - Read the `State.json` file to determine the current branch or detached state.
   - Update the `branchHead.json` file with the latest commit ID for the current branch if not in a detached state.

8. **Update Commit History:**
   - Read the existing commit history from the `commitLog.json` file.
   - Create a new commit object with the commit ID, message, date, and parent commit ID.
   - Write the updated commit history back to `commitLog.json`.

9. **Error Handling:**
   - Use a try-catch block to handle any errors that occur during file reading, writing, or updating.
   - Log errors using `console.log()` with appropriate messages.

## **3. Integration with Command-Line Interface**

- **Command Definition:**
  - Define the command `commit` using a CLI library like `yargs` or `commander`.
  - Integrate the `builder` function to define command-line options and arguments.
  - Integrate the `handler` function as the commandâ€™s action.

- **CLI Command:**
  - Ensure the command is registered correctly with the CLI library to be executed via the command line.

---

## **4. Utility Functions**

- **`statusHandler()`:**
  - A function from the `status.js` module used to update the index and ensure it is in sync before committing.
