# **Implementation Design for `checkout` Command**

---

## **1. Overview**

The `checkout` command allows you to switch to an existing branch in the Codetrack version control system. It updates the working directory to reflect the state of the specified branch and sets the current head to that branch.

## **2. Functionality Breakdown**

### **Command Execution:**
- **Command:** `checkout`
- **Description:** Checkout to an existing branch, updating the working directory to match the state of the specified branch.

### **Execution Steps:**

1. **Command Arguments:**
   - `branchName` (or `-br`): The name of the branch to switch to.

2. **Determine Current Directory:**
   - Use `cwd()` from the process module to get the current working directory.

3. **Read Branch Heads:**
   - Read the `branchHead.json` file from the `.codetrack/refs` directory to get the mapping of branch names to commit IDs.

4. **Validate Branch Name:**
   - Check if the provided `branchName` exists in the branch heads.
   - If not, throw an error indicating that the branch name does not exist.

5. **Update Head to Branch:**
   - Read the `State.json` file from the `.codetrack` directory.
   - Set the `head` to the specified `branchName` and mark the state as not `detached`.
   - Write the updated state back to `State.json`.

6. **Apply Commit State for Branch:**
   - Retrieve the commit ID associated with the branch from `branchHead.json`.
   - Read the index file associated with this commit ID from the `.codetrack/indices` directory.
   - For each file path in the index:
     - Read the file data from the `.codetrack/objects` directory using the hash stored in the index.
     - Write the file data back to the working directory.
   - Update the `.codetrack/index.json` file with the restored commit state.

7. **Error Handling:**
   - Use a try-catch block to handle any errors during file reading, writing, or updating.
   - Log errors using `console.log()` with appropriate messages.

## **3. Integration with Command-Line Interface**

- **Command Definition:**
  - Define the command `checkout` using a CLI library like `yargs` or `commander`.
  - Integrate the `builder` function to define command-line options and arguments.
  - Integrate the `handler` function as the commandâ€™s action.

- **CLI Command:**
  - Ensure the command is registered correctly with the CLI library to be executed via the command line.

---

## **4. Utility Functions**

- **`builder(yargs)`:**
  - Define the command-line option for `branchName` to specify the branch to checkout.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Ensure proper error messages are displayed when issues arise during execution.
