# **Implementation Design for `getImage` Command**

---

## **1. Overview**

The `getImage` command restores the working directory to the state it was in during a specific commit. It updates the working directory with files from a specified commit and updates the index to reflect this state.

---

## **2. Functionality Breakdown**

### **Command Execution:**
- **Command:** `getImage`
- **Description:** Bring your working directory to the state it had been during a specific commit. Files that were not present during that commit or were untracked will not be affected.

### **Execution Steps:**

1. **Command Arguments:**
   - `commitId` (or `-cId`): The ID of the commit to restore to.

2. **Determine Current Directory:**
   - Use `cwd()` from the process module to get the current working directory.

3. **Read Commit History:**
   - Read the commit history from the file `.codetrack/history/commitLog.json`.

4. **Validate Commit ID:**
   - Check if the provided `commitId` exists in the commit history.
   - If not, throw an error indicating that no such commit ID is present.

5. **Retrieve and Apply Commit State:**
   - Read the index file associated with the given `commitId` from the `.codetrack/indices` directory.
   - For each file path in the index:
     - Read the file data from the `.codetrack/objects` directory using the hash stored in the index.
     - Write the file data back to the working directory.

6. **Update Index File:**
   - Update the `.codetrack/index.json` file with the state of the restored commit.

7. **Update Head to Detached State:**
   - Read the `State.json` file from the `.codetrack` directory.
   - Set the `head` to the given `commitId` and mark the state as `detached`.
   - Write the updated state back to `State.json`.

8. **Error Handling:**
   - Use a try-catch block to handle any errors that occur during file reading, writing, or updating.
   - Log errors using `console.log()` with appropriate messages.

## **3. Integration with Command-Line Interface**

- **Command Definition:**
  - Define the command `getImage` using a CLI library like `yargs` or `commander`.
  - Integrate the `builder` function to define command-line options and arguments.
  - Integrate the `handler` function as the commandâ€™s action.

- **CLI Command:**
  - Ensure the command is registered correctly with the CLI library to be executed via the command line.

---

## **4. Utility Functions**

- **`builder(yargs)`:**
  - Define the command-line option for `commitId` to specify the commit to restore.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Ensure proper error messages are displayed when issues arise during execution.
