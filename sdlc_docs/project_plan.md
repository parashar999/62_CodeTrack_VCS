# `"CodeTrack": Project Plan`

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** CodeTrack

**Project Description:** CodeTrack is a local version control system designed for managing and tracking changes in files and directories. It operates independently on a local machine, providing essential version control functionalities similar to popular systems like Git but without requiring internet connectivity.

## 2. Objectives

- Develop a local version control CLI tool with core functionalities: initiating a repository, adding files, committing changes, showing logs, checking out branches/commits, and restoring the working directory to a specific commit state.
- Ensure the tool operates efficiently and reliably on a local machine without internet dependency.

## 3. Scope

### In-Scope

- **Initiate Repository:** Set up the repository structure and metadata.
- **Add Files:** Add specific files or entire directories to the version control system.
- **Commit Changes:** Save changes with commit messages and metadata.
- **Show Logs:** Display commit history and logs.
- **Checkout:** Switch between branches or specific commits.
- **Get Image:** Restore the working directory to a state from a specific commit.

### Out-of-Scope

- Remote repository management.
- Integration with external services or cloud-based systems.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1. **Initiate Repository**
   - Create necessary directories and files for repository metadata.
   - Initialize the version control system with default settings.

2. **Add Files**
   - Add individual files or entire directories to the tracking system.
   - Handle file and directory additions.

3. **Commit Changes**
   - Commit tracked files with messages.
   - Record commit metadata and snapshots.

4. **Show Logs**
   - Retrieve and display commit history and changes.

5. **Checkout**
   - Switch to different branches or specific commits.
   - Update the working directory accordingly.

6. **Get Image**
   - Restore files to the state they were in at a specific commit.
   - Handle untracked and missing files appropriately.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - Ensure operations complete efficiently even with a large number of files.

2. **Reliability**
   - Maintain data integrity and consistency throughout operations.

3. **Security**
   - Local storage of data with no external transmission, ensuring privacy.

## 6. Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** JavaScript (executed within the Node.js runtime)
- **Dependencies:**
  - `chalk` for CLI color output
  - `crypto` for hashing file contents
  - `yargs` for command-line argument parsing
- **Development Tools:**
  - **VS Code** for coding and debugging
  - **Git** for version control

## 7. Architecture

### Directory Structure

- **`/commands`**: Command implementations (e.g., `initiate`, `add`, `commit`, `log`, `getImage`, `checkout`).
- **`/utils`**: Utility functions (e.g., file operations, hashing).
- **`/bin`**: Entry point for the CLI tool.
- **`/codeTrack`**: Repository metadata and storage (e.g., index, objects).

### Core Components

- **Command Handlers:** Manage the functionality for each command.
- **Utilities:** Provide helper functions for hashing and file operations.
- **Data Storage:** Manage repository metadata, commit history, and file snapshots.

## 8. Project Phases

### 1. Planning
- Define project scope, objectives, and requirements.
- Develop detailed specifications and architectural design.

### 2. Design
- Create architectural diagrams and directory structure.
- Design CLI command interfaces and data formats.

### 3. Implementation
- Develop core functionalities and commands.
- Implement file operations, commit handling, and logging features.

### 4. Testing
- Conduct unit testing for individual components.
- Perform integration testing to ensure seamless operation.
- Execute end-to-end testing to validate version control workflows.

### 5. Deployment
- Package the CLI tool for local installation.
- Provide user documentation, including installation and usage instructions.

### 6. Maintenance
- Address bug reports and user feedback.
- Implement improvements and updates as necessary.

## 9. Risks and Mitigation

### Risks

1. **Insufficient Testing Coverage**
   - **Mitigation:** Develop comprehensive test cases and perform thorough testing.

2. **Performance Issues with Large Repositories**
   - **Mitigation:** Optimize file operations and indexing algorithms.

3. **User Errors or Misuse**
   - **Mitigation:** Provide clear and detailed documentation with error handling.

## 10. Deliverables

1. **CLI Tool:** A fully functional local version control system.
2. **Documentation:** User guide, installation instructions, and technical specifications.
3. **Test Reports:** Results from unit and integration testing.

## 11. Conclusion

**CodeTrack** aims to deliver a reliable and efficient local version control tool that operates independently of internet connectivity. By focusing on core version control functionalities and user-friendly CLI operations, the project will provide developers with a valuable tool for managing their codebase locally.
